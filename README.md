This repository contains the code associated with the scientific publication:  
**"Neighbor-Aware Informal Settlement Mapping with Graph Convolutional Networks"**  

## ðŸ“‚ Overview

This repository provides training and inference pipelines for the three models evaluated in the paper:
- **MLP baseline (no neighbor)**
- **MLP baseline (with neighbors)**
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**

**Data preprocessing and feature engineering** are handled in a separate repository:  
[https://github.com/thallop/balise-rio](https://github.com/thallop/balise-rio)  

**Additional metrics**: Tables showing full evaluation metrics beyond Kappa scores (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-score) are provided in the supplementary PDF included in this repository.
